### While working on this app I learned
- How to use react-native with expo go
- Basics of react-native and its differences with react for webDev
- Begin learning how to effectively style react-native components and its differences with CSS
- Basically almost everything while doing this app was new to me (elements, animations with probs)
## Installation
Will need to run npm install and get Expo go to run this app in phone.

## License

## Future development
I want to add async storage to save the list items  for later, but will do so after learning more of react-native.
